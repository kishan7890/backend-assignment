External Middlewares and Intro to DB
Building a File Uploader with Node.js and Express
Overview:
This project is focused on creating a file uploader service using Express in Node.js. You will set up an Express server that handles file uploads via a POST request and serves a simple HTML form for file submission. The objective is to understand how to work with file uploads in a Node.js environment using the Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data.

Topics Covered:
Express.js Server Setup
File Upload Handling
Working with Multer Middleware
Basic Frontend Form Submission
Problem Statement:
Develop an Express server with the ability to handle file uploads. The server should:

Serve an HTML form from the root route (/) for file submission.
Handle file uploads via a POST request to /upload.
Utilize the Multer middleware for processing file uploads.
Once the file has been processed by server, it needs to be uploaded to cloudinary and you need to store the url to send in the response.
Provide feedback to the user upon successful file upload with a status code of 200 and a confirmation message.
Folder Structure:
src
index.html - Contains the HTML form for file submission.
index.js - The main server file.
uploads - Directory for storing uploaded files (created by Multer).
Expected Behaviors:
GET Request to /: Should serve an HTML page with a form for file uploading, responding with status code 200.
POST Request to /upload: Allows file uploading through the form, and on success, responds with:
{
  "message": "file uploaded successfully",
  "imageUrl": "<cloudinaryLink>"
}
with a status code of 200.
