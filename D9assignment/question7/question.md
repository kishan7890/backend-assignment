Submission Instructions:
Please submit the Masai Repo Link.

Description:
you need to create a movie store api app, that supports all the opeartions of the Movies

Instructions
Create an entire Movie Store API using Express and Mongoose, use relavant Schema

The objective is to support all 4 CRUD operations, with a specific focus on multiple types of GET operations.

You need to decide the endpoints yourself.

For GET requests on the list of movies, support multiple filtering criteria:

Filter by title
Filter by rating
Search a movie by name. For example, if we make a query like /movies?q=dho, all movies that have Dho in their title should be returned: Dhoom, Dhoni: Untold Story, etc.
sortBy query parameter, which will sort the movies by a specified field.
Pagination: Implement pagination to limit the number of movies returned per request. Use page and limit query parameters to define the pagination.
Hint: MongoDB and Express application can be connected using Mongoose when you start running the server. Please explore.
