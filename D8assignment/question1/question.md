Learning Management System MongoDB Database
Total Objective: Create the Learning Management System (LMS) application MongoDB database by creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through direct interactions with MongoDB collections. This assignment will build familiarity with MongoDB concepts, collections, and CRUD operations.

L0: Basic MongoDB Setup and Collection Setup
Setup MongoDB and Collections:

Initialize a MongoDB database named LMS_DB.
Create two primary collections within this database:
users: for storing user profiles and their roles.
courses: for storing course information.
Insert Sample Data:

Manually add sample data in MongoDB for:
Users: Include at least 3 users with different roles (admin, instructor, and student).
Courses: Add at least 5 courses with properties like title, instructor, duration, and maximum capacity.
Basic Read Operations:

Retrieve all users and all courses from each collection.
Retrieve specific users based on role (e.g., fetch only instructors).
