Node.js Basic Math Operations
This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Node.js using separate modules for each operation.

Instructions
Study the sum.js and index.js, get the context of exporting and importing

Create a new file called multiplication.js and add the following code, similar to sum.js:

Modify index.js to include and use the multiplication function:

// index.js
const sum = require("./sum");
const multiply = require("./multiplication");

let sumA = 3;
let sumB = 5;
let sumResult = sum(sumA, sumB);
console.log(sumResult);

let mulA = 4;
let mulB = 6;
let mulResult = multiply(mulA, mulB);
console.log(mulResult);
Create two more operation files (subtraction.js and division.js) and repeat the process above same as of Multiplication, take of erros like dividing by zero.

Run the code in terminal by node index.js,

Think of whether commands can given in the terminal itself like node index.js sum 3 5...?, explore the command line arguments
